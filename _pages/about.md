<!-- Original content (commented out):
Shubhashis is a Computer Science PhD Researcher under [Dr. Frank Ferarro](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/people/faculty/frank-ferraro/) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). His research combines **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) and **Computer Vision** (CV).

His broad research focuses on **Decomposition-based Reasoning** using text or vision data. Currently, he is focused on question based decomposition to understand the scientific feasibility of a given task (**[*SEM 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16838)**).

Over the years, he has worked on **Outcome and Intention based Decomposition** and how it can be used for video-text retrieval (**[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10202)**). This research has applications in video/image retrieval system, especially where there is no text metadata available for the video (e.g., most of the videos on the internet, social media, and surveillance videos). Also, his previous work, a hierarchical variational autoencoder for **Event Representation Learning**, has applications in text summarization, question answering, and <span class="tooltip-text" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="What would happen if some facts are changed?">counterfactual</span> reasoning (Published in **[*SEM 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.starsem-1.31?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page)**).

In **Summer 2025**, he interned at [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/) as an Applied Scientist. He has shown how [Deliberative Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16339) can be used to optimize cost by ruducing token of the tool-calling LLMs (**paper coming soon**).  

In **Summer 2024**, he interned at [Scale.AI](https://scale.com) as a Machine Learning Researcher. He explored how RL can improve the text2SQL generation (**[Scale.AI Blog](https://scale.com/blog/rlhf-text2sql)**). He also improved text2SQL AutoEval using Small Language Model to use as efficient reward model.

Shubhashis has a strong background in ML programming, including PyTorch, ðŸ¤— HuggingFace, NLTK, Spacy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more. He has excelled in machine learning competitions (**[Kaggle top-70 ðŸ¥‰](/projects/kaggle_bird?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page)**) and coding competitions (**[ACM ICPC 8th out of 300+ teams](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/dhaka-2019/standings)**) and [more](/awards?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page). He was the founder of **[UniShopr](https://unishopr.com)** (2018-2022), a cross-border e-commerce for his home country (Bangladesh).

Shubhashis is a Ph.D. Researcher in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), advised by [Dr. Frank Ferraro](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/people/faculty/frank-ferraro/). His work bridges **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) and **Computer Vision** (CV), with a focus on **Decomposition-based Reasoning** â€” enabling machines to reason through complex tasks by breaking them into atomic questions.

His current research explores presupposition-free question-based decomposition for assessing the scientific feasibility of tasks [[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16838)]. Previously, he investigated **Outcome- and Intention-based Decomposition** for video-text retrieval [[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10202)], targeting settings where videos lack textual metadata (e.g., social media or surveillance contexts). His earlier work on **Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders for Event Representation Learning** demonstrated strong applications in text summarization, question answering, and counterfactual reasoning [[3](https://aclanthology.org/2023.starsem-1.31?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page)].

In Summer 2025, he interned at **Amazon** (Alexa Team) as an Applied Scientist. He has shown how [Deliberative Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16339) technique can be used to optimize cost by ruducing token of the tool-calling LLMs (*paper coming soon*).  

In Summer 2024, he interned at **Scale AI** (Enterprise Team) as a Machine Learning Researcher. He has explored how RL can improve the text2SQL generation by using a small LLM-as-a-Judge during reinforcement loop ([Scale AI Blog](https://scale.com/blog/rlhf-text2sql)).

Beyond academia, Shubhashis has a strong background in machine learning systems, applied modeling, and programming. He has ranked among the *[top 70 on Kaggle](/projects/kaggle_bird?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page)* ðŸ¥‰ and placed *[8th out of 300+ teams in the ACM ICPC](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/dhaka-2019/standings)* and [more](/awards?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page). In his initial years, he founded [UniShopr](https://unishopr.com) (2017â€“2021) â€” a cross-border e-commerce platform serving consumers in Bangladesh.
